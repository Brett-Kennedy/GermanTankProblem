# GermanTankProblem

This is a single notebook that provides some analysis and experiments related to the German Tank Problem. The problem is described in Bernoulli's Fallacy by Aubrey Clayton, Columbia Press as:

"During World War II, in the days leading up to the invasion of Normandy, Allied forces were faced with a difficult problem in statistical inference. The German military had recently introduced a new model of tank, the Panzer V. ... The Allies needed to know how many of these tanks they could expect to encounter in northern France. ... What they had were serial numbers of various parts ... of Panzer V tanks they had either captured or destroyed, which would enable statistical analysis. Importantly, they assumed these numbers were generated in sequence, so the relative sizes of the numbers could give them some clue of how many tanks had been manufactured ... What they needed to know was the highest number that had been generated, which would reveal the total number of tanks that had been produced. They made further assumptions that ehe tank parts they discovered were equally likely to have come from anywhere in the sequence and that the parts that ended up in tanks in various places were effectively independent from one another. Relabelling the numbers from 1..., the problem became the following:

Given a collection of k integers, n1,...nk sampled independently and uniformly from the range from 1 to N, with N unknown, come up with a way to estimate N.
