# GermanTankProblem

## Background
This is a single, simple notebook that provides some analysis and experiments related to the German Tank Problem. The problem is described in Bernoulli's Fallacy by Aubrey Clayton, (2021) Columbia Press as:

> "During World War II, in the days leading up to the invasion of Normandy, Allied forces were faced with a difficult problem in statistical inference. The German military had recently introduced a new model of tank, the Panzer V. ... The Allies needed to know how many of these tanks they could expect to encounter in northern France. ... What they had were serial numbers of various parts ... of Panzer V tanks they had either captured or destroyed, which would enable statistical analysis. Importantly, they assumed these numbers were generated in sequence, so the relative sizes of the numbers could give them some clue of how many tanks had been manufactured ... What they needed to know was the highest number that had been generated, which would reveal the total number of tanks that had been produced. They made further assumptions that the tank parts they discovered were equally likely to have come from anywhere in the sequence and that the parts that ended up in tanks in various places were effectively independent from one another. Relabelling the numbers from 1..., the problem became the following:

> *Given a collection of k integers, n<sub>1</sub>,...n<sub>k</sub> sampled independently and uniformly from the range from 1 to N, with N unknown, come up with a way to estimate N.* 

> It turns out that a good estimator for N is given by the statistic:

$$ \hat{N} = Max * {{k+1} \over k} -1 $$

> Where Max is the *data maximum*, meaning the largest number among n<sub>1</sub>,...n<sub>k</sub>. This captures the intuitive idea that if we had observed only one value (k=1), we'd gues it to be about midway through the list on average, so we might think to double it as a guess for the maximum. If we had observed two values, we'd imagine them to be roughly equally spaced on average, at positions around 1/3 and 2/3 of the total. So the larger of the two should be about two-thirds of the highest possible value, suggesting a guess of about Max * (3/2), etc. 

> This estimator happens to have the friendly property of being the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) for this parameter. 

For other discussion, see Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability by Fredrick Mosteller (1965), Dover Press as the Locamotive Problem:

> (a) A railroad numbers its locamotives in order: 1, 2, ... N. One day you see a locamotive and it's number is 60. Guess how many locamotives the company has
> (b) You have looked at 5 locamotives and the largest number observed is 60. Again guess how many locomatives the company has.

This presents the same logic, at least for being as close to correct on average in the long run, using a principle called the principle of symetry: When n points are dropped at random on an interval, the lengths of the n+1 line segments have identical distribution. 

## Motivation

Considering the German Tank problem, intuitively, the largest serial number found has more signal than the serial numbers of the other parts found. But, it can be quite unititive that the best model would use only this information, ignoring the other serial numbers found, which do each provide some information. For example, relying on this single serial number allows for situations where, instead of the last number found being roughly evenly spaced, the last number is unusaully close to the second-last serial number found, leading to an underestimate of N, or the last serial number found is unusually close to the true N, leading to an overestimate of N. Using the other other serial numbers could mitigate these situations. 

This notebook explores methods incorporating information from the other serial numbers discovered.

## Experimental Setup 

We consider cases where 100 parts are found, and use a variety of estimators to estimate N, including the estimator described above, estimators including information from other parts found, and machine learning models. 

We measure accuracy as: 

$$ ABS(N - \hat{N}) \over N $$

The experiments test using each of the discovered part numbers, using a similar formula:

$$ \hat{N} = Value Found * {{k+1} \over rank} -1 $$

For example, if using the 80th of 100 parts found, the estimate is: (value of 80th parth * (101/80)) - 1.

Experiments then take the mean or median of the estimates. A technique referred to as *capping* is also employed, where estimates that are known to be impossible, as they are less than the observed maximum, are excluded from the pool of estimates to be averaged. 

The errors are then averaged over 100,000 trials, taking the median error.


## Results

Examining first where only the maximum is used, the experimental data appears as: (with the true N in red and estimate in green):

Examining next using other parts, we first look using the first 10 found:

!["first 10"](https://github.com/Brett-Kennedy/GermanTankProblem/blob/main/images/using_first_10.jpg)

Then the middle 10:

!["middle 10"](https://github.com/Brett-Kennedy/GermanTankProblem/blob/main/images/using_mid_10.jpg)

Then the last 10:
!["last 10"](https://github.com/Brett-Kennedy/GermanTankProblem/blob/main/images/using_last_10.jpg)

Using all:
!["all"](https://github.com/Brett-Kennedy/GermanTankProblem/blob/main/images/using_all.jpg)


It can be seen that the estimates using the maximum are quite close. And that the estimates from the first 10 are quite poor; those from the middle 10 better, and those from the last 10 better still. And so, as expected, the later in the sequence the parts used are taken, the better the estimate. But, this leaves the question if using the earlier observations still has some value, if combined with the maximum observation. 

We next experiment with taking the mean and median of some or all of the observations. 

Examining the results for median error (smaller is better) for the techniques tried, simply using the maximum part found, in fact, works the best. Some other techiques work nearly as well, but it can be seen: the less parts considered, the better, with the optimum being a single part, the maximum.

### Experiments with Random Forest

Experiments with random forests were done using all 100 parts found as features. As the training size was increased, the random forest learned better to use less features, and to rely more heavily on the later features. Given a sufficient number of training records (approximately 6,000 to 10,000) in this case, the random forest learns to rely entirely on the maximum part found. 

## Conclusions
This is another example where adding features, even features with real signal to a model decreases, as opposed to increasing, the overall accuracy. In this case the features are clearly non-independent of each other. It is, however, not possible to prove a negative result here, and further experiments with other techniques to incorporate multiple observations may work better than those presented here. For example, it would be possible to weight observations and to adjust less-plausible estimations using techniques other than those presented here. This is simply a presentation, and not proof, of the optimality of the estimator.
